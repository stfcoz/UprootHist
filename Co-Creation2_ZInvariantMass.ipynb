Of course, you can't do dimensional analysis any more, but it makes a lot of things easier - trust me. For one thing, our mass equation turns out to be pretty simple: $m = \\sqrt{E^2 - p^2}$. \n",

You had no real way of checking whether or not the decay that the theory described is actually what happens in reality, other than saying that the plots look roughly about right.\n",

The extent to which the two agree then tells us how close our model is to reality.\n",

You may notice that it looks pretty close to what we had before - that's because there are lots and lots of Z decays that happen in the detector. If you looked closely enough, you would be able to tell that there are other colours stacked there in the histogram, but the slices are so thin that you can't see them.\n",
